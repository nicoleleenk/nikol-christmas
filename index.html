  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Athy! 🎄</h2>
  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you, Athy! It has been a while since we have spoken in person,
    but still wanted to write a letter to you! I hope that Okinawa has been good to you and as the year is
    coming to a close, I wanna thank you for your presence and your love for others.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way you put others first and choose to be part of them is admirable: something that we often lack
    as a human race and as people who follow Christ. Thank you for choosing to meet people at their level
    and going to win people in Okinawa! Honestly, it is such a hard place to win people, especially on an island.
    So good job you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Okay, enough of the blah blah, I really appreciate you as a friend! Thank you for being friends with me too.
    See you in 2027! &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-becky" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Becky! 🎄</h2>
  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Becky! I am glad that we have gotten closer this year!
    Not going to lie, I never thought that this would happen LMAO, although I wouldn’t trade anything for
    how it turned out.
  </p>
  <p>
    I appreciate your gentle heart towards others and your constant care for the people around you —
    in ways that only you as Becky Yap can give.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the memories that changed my perspective was the first time we roomed together on the cruise.
    I had never been woken up so gently before LMAO, and it honestly changed the way I try to do things
    more gently too.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once again, Merry Christmas. I hope you enjoy the paint by numbers — please take a picture for me.
    Love you lots as always, never change pls &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-carissa" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Carissa! 🎄</h2>
  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Carissa! You are one of my fellow Christian nurse friends
    and I am very appreciative of being in the same line as you.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you are coming out of youth and I am heading to Japan, I believe this new season will be fruitful —
    not a resting period, but a honing period. A time to prepare to pierce through.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please don’t hesitate to talk to me, and I hope you enjoy the Switch while I’m gone!
    Love you lots &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-charlene" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Charlene! 🎄</h2>
  <p>
    This might feel random, but I really wanted to express my gratitude for you this Christmas.
    You radiate a calmness and comfort that makes people feel safe without trying.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m really thankful to be able to call you a friend — someone I can walk up to, hug,
    and feel completely at ease with. Please never change 
  </p>
</div>

<div id="card-charlotte" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Charlotte! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year Charlotte! To start off, I'd like to say that
    I think that you are a very funny person — you crack me up in the best way possible
    and that is very charming of you.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are very quirky in your own way and it brings a certain comfort along with it.
    It means that you are comfortable being yourself and you're not afraid of judgement
    from the people that you are with, so thank you. You make me feel very comfortable,
    that I don't need to be funny to be heard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyway, enough of the sap! Merry Christmas, Charlotte, thank you for being friends
    with me, I love you lots! &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-cindy" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Cindy! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year Cindy! I can't believe we're still friends!
    Just kidding. I am honoured to be friends with you — someone I can crack jokes with
    and know I wouldn't go too far.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being a good friend, someone who doesn't question and will go out of
    your way (as much as possible) to help someone in need.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you talked about needing to go for surgery, I was honestly really scared.
    But I prayed about it and remembered that God is not a cruel God. I believe with
    all my heart that whatever happens will be part of His plan and for His glory.
  </p>

  <p>
    I really don't want to lose you as a friend. Please remember that I don't see you
    as a handicapped person, but simply as Cindy Soh.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love you very much, even though I might not say it often — so if you ever need
    to hear it, please come back to this message because I am not going to say it in
    real life LOL &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-cleo" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Cleo! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year Cleo! Sometimes I can't fathom how we have only
    been friends for a year plus because it feels like we have known each other for years.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your genuine spirit for community and inviting everyone to gather, eat, and spend
    time together brings me so much joy. I really respect that about you.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope our friendship never changes — that even through busy seasons, we will see
    each other bear spiritual fruit and dwell in God's courts all the days of our lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love you a lot, and there is nothing in this world I would trade that for. &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-esther" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Esther! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year Esther! Thank you for being such a great friend
    and someone I can always find during Sunday service.
  </p>

  <p>
    We keep talking about going out to eat — let's really do it before I go for missions
    (which honestly means we need to do it soon LOL).
  </p>

  <p>
    Love you lots, please always remember that. &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-fiona" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Fiona! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Fiona! I am really grateful to have drawn
    closer to you — to have a low-maintenance friendship that can pause and resume so
    naturally.
  </p>

  <p>
    You inspire me a lot. Your patience and ability to teach without judgement is something
    you should be very proud of. Even when there are slip-ups, your intentions are never evil.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyway, enough of the sap. I love you lots and I love your humour — please never change. &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-hillary" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Hillary! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Hillary! I can't believe that we have
    been friends for 15 years (I think — I kinda lost count). I really have to thank God
    for you and our friendship. You have seen me from when I was a literal hooligan to
    who I am now, and you played a huge part in that.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't think I've ever told you this before, but when you first said you wanted to
    stop cursing in secondary school, it really made me think about what it meant to be
    a real Christian — to be Christ-like and different from the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    I admire your courage and your willingness to take the first step to initiate change,
    to say things many people think about but are too afraid to act on. Sometimes when I
    need courage, I ask myself, “How would Hillary do this?”
  </p>

  <p>
    You're a role model not just to me, but to many around you. Please never doubt that.
    Anyway, I love you very much — you're my favourite social worker &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-joelle" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Joelle! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Joelle! I still can't believe you're back
    from Fukuoka LOL — just kidding.
  </p>

  <p>
    This year, I really want to thank you for your constant care for me and for the people
    around you. Yes, it might be your role in church, but it takes a special heart to do
    it with such sincerity and purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your wisdom and steadiness in your faith and foundation on the Word are truly admirable.
    Sometimes I think, “Oh, that’s true — why didn’t I think of that?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being Nan and I’s ML buddy and basically hard-carrying our team.
    Maybe that’s why this is my first time hitting Epic LOL.
    Love you lots, Joelle &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-jovi" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Jovi! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Jovi (and Andrew hehe).
    I’m really appreciative of you — your genuine love for people, your care for others,
    and you and Andrew’s desire to host and provide comfort.
  </p>

  <p>
    I can never thank you enough for the hospitality you both show me.
    Sometimes I wonder if I deserve it, especially since I literally bring nothing
    to the table — literally and figuratively.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please kindly wait for me to come back from missions and earn some money,
    because I really want to bring you both out for a meal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please never change who you are. Let’s meet before I go for missions —
    I’ll miss you and Andrew a lot.
    Merry Christmas and love you lots &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-mielan" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Mielan! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Mielan! I can't believe we’ve been friends
    for about 8 years already. Sometimes I wonder what life would’ve been like if we had
    never crossed paths — and I’m really glad I never had to find out.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do miss you quite a bit. It sucks that when we don’t see each other often,
    we naturally drift apart. Sometimes I struggle to understand that,
    especially when love is meant to be the greatest of all.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m sorry if I haven’t shown you enough grace or love.
    If I’ve hurt you or misunderstood you, please forgive me.
  </p>

  <p>
    There’s a lot more I want to say, but I returned my vocabulary after turning 18.
    Let’s please meet before you go to Canada.
    Love you lots, Mielan &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-miko" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Miko! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Miko!
    I think I write this in every letter I give you, but you truly are a miracle to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for your love for me and the people around you — for coming to others with
    a genuine heart to bless, to make people feel comfortable and loved, and for wanting
    to provide a safety net so others don’t go through the same things you did.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for your love for your CG, for meeting people where they are at, for being
    a voice for your members, and for wanting the best for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    My prayer for you is that none of this will be done in vain.
    God sees you, knows how you feel, and He will never leave nor forsake you.
    Trust in Him — He will turn all things for good.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyway, I love you lots, and there’s nothing I would trade for our friendship &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-nan" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Nan! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Nan!
    It’s been 8 years since we’ve known each other — can you believe that?
    Honestly, I can’t.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are times I feel like I may have wronged or offended you,
    and I want to say sorry for that.
    I’m not always gentle with my words, so please accept my apology.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being my best friend.
    If you asked me 7 years ago whether we’d be here today,
    I think I would’ve doubted it a lot.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will really miss you when I go for missions.
    There’s comfort in you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lastly, there is really Nan like you.
    You are unapologetically firm in your faith, and that is admirable.
    Sometimes I wish I had even 1% of your confidence.
    I love you lots Nan &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

 <div id="card-nicolle" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Nicolle! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Nicolle!
    12 months have passed since last Christmas — so fast —
    and you’re already almost back in Singapore after your time in Osaka.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being a great friend.
    Sometimes I feel like I don’t bring much to this friendship
    and that it’s 90% you and 10% me — and I want to say sorry for that.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are moments where I wonder if we’d be friends outside of church
    because we’re very different people,
    but somehow this friendship still works.
  </p>

  <p>
    Speaking of the 90% — I really admire your wisdom and your ability to know
    what to do in difficult situations.
    Many people look up to you, and I’m definitely one of them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyway — please continue being you.
    Let’s meet before I go (that’s a whole other year LOL).
    I love you lots, you are very cool &lt;3
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="card-priscilla" class="card">
  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas, Priscilla! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Priscilla!
    We’ve known each other for 10 years already, which is honestly quite crazy to think about.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of my fond memories of us was when you first brought me to Fright Night in 2015.
    I was so young, and I mostly remember myself running away because it was also the first
    time we had really known each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t think you remember it, but I find it really funny now.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m really glad that we’re still able to hang out and even go on overseas trips together.
    Thank you for being my friend, and I believe that 2026 will be great for you.
    Love you &lt;3
  </p>

    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Rachel!
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being such a great friend.
    You are someone who naturally bonds people together,
    and I’m really thankful to have someone like you in our region.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s something our region really needs,
    and it takes effort and genuine care to do what you do.
    Remember to do it with God’s strength and not your own.
  </p>

  <p>
    Love you lots, friend &lt;3
    Merry Christmas hehe

  <h2>🎄 Merry Christmas! 🎄</h2>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you!
  </p>

  <p>
    I just realised that I’ve never written a letter to you before —
    so Merry Christmas!
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for a great year of being friends.
    I’m not the best with words, but I’m really glad that I’m friends with you hehe.

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Sarah!
  </p>

  <p>
    I really want to thank God for you.
    I can’t believe we’re coming up on one year of friendship already —
    time really flies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being someone I can let my guard down with,
    where I can just sit and listen to you yap
    instead of feeling like I need to lead a conversation.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m going to miss you when I go for missions,
    so let’s meet before I leave!!

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Shermaine!
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s been about 5 years since we’ve known each other,
    which is honestly pretty crazy to think about.
    If I think about who you were 5 years ago versus now,
    you’ve really grown so much.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes I wonder what would’ve happened if you had chosen not to come,
    or not to be connected with VFC — we probably wouldn’t have had this friendship.
  </p>

  <p>
    I really admire your courage to recklessly love (and I promise this isn’t an insult).
    I still remember you inviting your entire class to hear the gospel.
    I wish I had that kind of courage and understanding of God at that age.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love you lots, please never doubt that.
    There has never been a time where I didn’t,
    even when I go NKJDSNJFDNSD &lt;333

    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Tanya!
  </p>

  <p>
    Wow — we’ve known each other for almost 10 years,
    which is honestly pretty crazy to say out loud.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have to be honest: for the longest time,
    I felt like we had a “business friendship”
    because we mostly saw each other at church.
    But this year, it really feels like we’ve grown closer,
    and I’m very thankful for that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being unapologetically weird with me
    (even though people think I’m weirder than you).
    Thank you for your love for people and for reaching out to others
    the same way Christ reached out to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once again, Merry Christmas!
    I love you very much, and I will give you a kiss

  <p>
    I realised that I’ve never written a Christmas letter to you before,
    so here it is!
  </p>

  <p>
    We’ve gotten closer over the past two years after I came out of YA,
    and I’m really excited to continue doing life together with you.
    Thank you for always answering my medical questions
    and for being such a great friend.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also — it’s good to know that your favourite animal is a gorilla,
    and I don’t think I’ll ever forget that HAHA.

    Love you lots! Merry Christmas!

    We’ve gotten closer this year, and honestly,
    I’m really very happy that we have.
    This friendship feels long overdue because we really vibe so well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whenever we talk, you look at me like I truly matter to you,
    and I really appreciate that.
    I feel very loved just by the way you treat me,
    and I hope I’m giving you even half of what you give me.
  </p>

    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Ynez!
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s been about 10 years since we’ve known each other,
    and that is honestly such a long time — WOW!
    I can’t believe it’s already been that long,
    and I’m really so grateful that we’re friends.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m always really happy to see a familiar face every Sunday service,
    and to have someone to eat lunch with after.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for your love for me and for the people around you,
    for caring for others the same way Christ does.
    I always enjoy hugging you because it feels comforting and homely hehe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Love you a lot Ynez — Merry Christmas!!! &lt;3

    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Yu Qing!
  </p>

  <p>
    I remember the xmm you were so many years ago,
    and sometimes I can’t believe that you’re who you are today
    — in a really good way.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t really have much to say other than that
    I’m really proud of you for how far you’ve come.
    The victories God has given you came from the faith you placed in Him,
    and that is really endearing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Love you lots bro &lt;3 hehe

    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you and Alice!
    (Please read this together with Alice!)
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve never written a Christmas letter for you before,
    so I guess there’s a first for everything!
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you so much to you and Alice for your hospitality and love for me.
    Thank you for extending your hand to me when I needed it —
    I’ve never looked back since.
  </p>

  <p>
    Somehow, you, Alice, and I are able to vibe really well together,
    and I’m very appreciative of that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas, and see you all on the 28th! :)

  <p>
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you Janet!
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve never written a Christmas card to you before,
    so this is a first!
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being such a good friend to me —
    someone who is objective and knows how to plan
    (especially being in VFC LOL).
  </p>

  <p>
    I never thought we would become this close,
    but I’m really grateful to have you as a friend.
    Thank you for always lending a hand when needed
    and laughing at my stupid jokes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Too bad though — you’ve already signed up
    for a whole new year with me :D
  </p>

  <p>
    Merry Christmas, love you very much! &lt;3
